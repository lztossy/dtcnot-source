Hello everyone,

You might be wondering why this has been leaked.

The original owner, rzr1931 (*also known as starhook, r4ave, rave1337*), has scammed multiple individuals, and one incident has recently come to light. Rzr utilized a browser utility to scrape the source code of a popular website, https://kycnot.me/, and publicly deployed it while falsely claiming credit for creating both the code and UI/UX.

# How did I get into this scandal? 
Shortly after the release, I audited the website and discovered that it was poorly constructed, highly exploitable, and disorganized. I reached out to the owner to address these issues, which led me to completely rewrite the entire source code using my own stack (NJS/TS). I also added essential features such as enhanced security, load balancing, mitigation measures, and basic Cloudflare precautions.

# Why is this getting leaked?
I have zero tolerance for scammers, especially those who attempt to lead a community based on trustworthiness and reputation. Therefore, I am leaking this source code to ensure the future of DTCNOT is effectively terminated.

# Deployment
